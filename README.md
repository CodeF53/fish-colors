# Fish Colors
Fish Colors is a [Chime](https://github.com/emilyalexandra/chime) resource pack that makes tropical fish buckets display the colors, shape, and pattern of the fish. This program generates that resource pack, given a set of simple images of the base shapeXpattern combos of fish, with the varying section grayscaled and designated with slight opacity changes.

## Building
* Build with dub.
* Have the following `.png`s in `in/` in the folder where the program is ran (this is the case by default).
  * 0, 1, 256, 256, 512, 513, 768, 769, 1024, 1025, 1280, 1281 
* Get the generated resource pack in the `out/` folder

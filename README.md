# Fish Colors
Fish Colors is a [Chime](https://github.com/emilyalexandra/chime) resource pack that makes tropical fish buckets display the colors of the fish inside the bucket. This program generates that resource pack, given a simple image of the original tropical fish bucket, with the varying section grayscaled and designated with slight opacity changes.

## Building
* Build with dub.
* Have `in/fish.png` in the folder where the program is ran (this is the case by default).
* Get the generated resource pack in the `out/` folder
